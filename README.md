Air pollution kills 7 million people every year. According to the World Health Organization data, 90 out of every 100 people breathe polluted air. As a result, the health risk is increasing at 23 percent every year. Influence of polluted air can cause cancer, asthma, blindness, heart disease and even congenital problems. About 85 percent of the total polluted air comes from vehicles and factories. The wash emitted from the vehicle's engine is 87% contaminated. 
Toxic wash of vehicles contains:- 
1. Hydrocarbon. 
2. Carbon-monoxide. 
3. Nitrogen oxide. 
4. Carbon dioxide-greenhouse gas. 

The World Environmental Protection Agency has revealed the amount of air pollution a car makes every day and every year. A medium-sized family car makes 5503.3kg or 12132.69967 pounds of polluted air every year. 

A NASA study has found that if air pollution is increased at this rate, its hazard will stand in such a way that mattresses of polluted air can be seen empty-handed. Many countries around the world are working to get rid of the problem. But we haven't noticed any such effective solution yet. For this reason, we have found a solution to this problem to save the world from this curse. In the meantime, we have come up with an innovative service and product for everyone. The name of our product is "O-Zone" powered by YES (Young Entrepreneur Society)

The service of our product:- 
"O-Zone" is an eco-friendly complete polluted air purifying system. Through this we will purify the toxic smoke emitted from the vehicles. All types of harmful material contained in toxic wash will be trapped in our device. After a long period of using, the user will be able to easily remove any contaminants that may be present in the device. So that the toxic smoke emitted from the engine will not mix in the environment. We have already applied our device on vehicles. We received satisfactory results from our device after implementation in vehicles. Now our device is able to purify 94% of the vehicle's toxic fumes. Also the smoke emitted was colorless and odorless. Such a result has really encouraged us even more in the early stages of development. We will develop this product further in the near future. We will make sure the device emits 100% pure smoke.

Currently, it costs us 567 to make each device. When we manufacture the device commercially, the production cost of the device will be 470 to 500 taka. If we add a marketing cost and VAT on our product, the price of the product will be 480 to 510 taka. At a very low cost, we can rid the world of this curse. In starting, our target market in Bangladesh. Next we will export the product worldwide. 

Since we have no competitors, so that we will have dominance in the local and global markets. 

In the near future we will be bringing a digital and self-contained service to solve all vehicle-related problems, in addition to smoke cleansing in the near future. We are developing software that will solve all types of vehicle problems. The services that are in our future plan:

1. Our software will continuously inform the user about the fitness of its vehicles.
2. It will detect fake licenses automatically. 
3. Our software will monitor users speed. If user attempt to over speeding, our software will automatically update it on the authorityâ€™s server. 
4. If a user breaks a traffic law, our software will immediately report it to the police
5. Our software will play a leading role in identifying unmanned vehicles
